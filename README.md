# 50.021 readme

1. Everything in training-scripts-from-github is just a copy of all branches in the repository https://github.com/zhangruihan1/cell-count-and-segmentation, which we don't need to really import or run.
2. In training-notebooks-and-checkpoints, we have our method (adaptive re-indexing) in the folder methods-current, as well as other failing methods in methods-matyrs. We use the notebooks to train our model. All required modules would be automatically downloaded from github and imported. To load your own Google Drive is not required. That is simply for us to save the checkpoints.
3. In the demonstrating-codes-with-GUI folder, we have a full set of required models and their checkpoints, as well as our GUI. All of them are in .py files. You may watch the usage of running the demo from this URL. https://youtu.be/oaNUC19SLAk
